	NAME
		srec - convert Motorola DSP load file records to
		       S-record format

	SYNOPSIS
		srec [-blmrsw] <input file ... >

	DESCRIPTION
		Srec takes as input a Motorola DSP absolute load file and
		produces byte-wide Motorola S-record files suitable for
		PROM burning.  The Motorola DSP START and END records are
		mapped into S0 and S7/S9 records respectively.  All other
		DSP record types are mapped into S1 or S3-type records
		depending on the source processor.  SYMBOL and COMMENT records
		are currently ignored.

		Since Motorola DSPs use different word sizes, the words
		must be split into bytes and stored in an appropriate format.
		The program examines the machine type field in the load
		file start record to determine the appropriate S-record
		format to use.  For example, if the machine ID in the START
		record is DSP56000 or DSP56016, srec generates S1/S9 output
		records; if the machine ID is DSP96000, the program generates
		S3/S7 records.

		In the default mode of operation the program writes the
		low, middle, and high bytes of each word
		consecutively to the current S1/S3 record being written.  For
		example, given the DSP56000 DATA record below:

				address field
				|
			_DATA P 0000
			0008F8 300000 340000 094E3E
			|      |      |      |
			|      |      |      fourth word
			|      |      third word
			|      second word
			first word

		srec would create the following S1 record:

			  byte count field
			  | address  field              checksum field
			  | |                           |
			S10D0000F808000000300000343E4E09F9
			        |     |     |     |
			        |     |     |     fourth word
			        |     |     third word
			        |     second word
			        first word

		Output records are written to a file named according to
		the following convention:

			<basename>.M

		where <basename> is the filename of the input load file
		without extension and M is the memory space specifier
		(X, Y, L, or P) for this set of data words.  Note that a
		separate file is created for each memory space encountered
		in the input file; thus the maximum number of output files
		in the default mode is 4.

		When the -m option is specified, srec splits each DSP source
		word into bytes and stores the bytes in parallel S1/S3
		records.  For example, the following DSP56000 DATA record:

				address field
				|
			_DATA P 0000
			0008F8 300000 340000 094E3E
			|      |      |      |
			|      |      |      fourth word
			|      |      third word
			|      second word
			first word

		would be converted by srec into the three S1 records below:

			  byte count field
			  | address  field
			  | |
			S1070000F800003EC2 -- low  byte
			S10700000800004EA2 -- mid  byte
			S1070000003034098B -- high byte
				| | | | |
				| | | | checksum field
				| | | fourth word
				| | third word
				| second word
				first word

		The three records corresponding to the high, middle, and
		low bytes of each data word are written to separate files.
		The files are named according to the following convention:

			<basename>.<M><#>

		where <basename> is the filename of the input load file
		without extension, <M> is the memory space specifier
		(X, Y, L, or P) for this set of data words, and # is
		one of the digits 0, 1, or 2 corresponding to low, middle,
		and high bytes, respectively.

		Note that a separate set of byte-wide files is created for
		each memory space encountered in the input file.  Thus the
		number of output files generated is (number of memory spaces
		in input * size of DSP word).

		The -s option writes all information to a single file,
		storing the memory space information in the address field
		of the S0 header record.  The values stored in the address
		field and their correspondence to the DSP56000 memory
		spaces are as follows:

			Value		DSP56000 Memory Space
			-----		---------------------
			  1			X
			  2			Y
			  3			L
			  4			P

		When the memory space changes in the DATA or BLOCKDATA
		record, a new S0 header record is generated.  The resulting
		output file is named <basename>.s, where <basename> is
		the filename of the input load file without extension.
		The -m and -s options are mutually exclusive.

		The -r option causes srec to write bytes high to low rather
		than low to high in the default and -s modes.  It has no
		affect when the -m option is given.

		Address fields in DSP load records are copied as is to
		the appropriate S1 or S3 record.  Subsequent S1 or S3
		record addresses are byte incremented until a new DATA
		record is encountered or end-of-file is reached.  In some
		cases the starting S1/S3 record address must be adjusted for
		byte addressing by multiplying the load record start address
		by the number of bytes in a DSP56000 word.  When the -b
		option is given, any DATA record address fields are adjusted
		to begin on a byte-multiple address.  If the -w option is
		specified (the default) byte-incrementing is not done
		when generating S-record addresses, e.g. the S-record
		addresses are word-oriented rather than byte-oriented.
		The -b and -w options have no effect when used in conjunction
		with the -m mode, since in that case byte and word address
		mappings are 1:1.

		DATA records for L space memory contain words which are loaded
		into adjacent X and Y memory locations.  In these cases
		performing the default strict word addressing may be
		inappropriate.  The -l option can be given to indicate
		that double-word addressing should be used to generate
		subsequent S1/S3 addresses after the initial load address.
		In addition the -l option should be used when doing byte
		addressing since the initial load addresses must be adjusted
		to account for double-word addressing in the load file.
		In general, it is a good idea to use the -l option whenever
		the source load file contains DATA records which refer to
		L memory space.

		In the START record only the module id is passed as header
		data for the S0 record; the version number, revision number,
		and comment are ignored.  As noted earlier, the machine ID
		field is used to determine what type of S-records to generate
		based on the addressing range of the DSP processor.

	OPTIONS
		-b	- use byte addressing when transferring load addresses
			  to S-record addresses.  This means that load file
			  DATA record start addresses are multiplied by
			  the DSP bytes/word and subsequent S1/S3 record
			  addresses are computed based on the data byte count.
		-l	- use double-word addressing when transferring load
			  addresses from L space to S-record addresses.  This
			  means that load file DATA records for L space data
			  are moved unchanged and subsequent S1/S3 record
			  addresses are computed based on the data word count
			  divided by 2.  This option should always be used
			  when the source load file contains DATA records in L
			  memory space.
		-m	- split each DSP word into bytes and store
			  the bytes in parallel S-records.   Replaces
			  the -3 option.  The -m and -s options are
			  mutually exclusive.
		-r	- write bytes high to low, rather than low to
			  high.  Has no effect when used with -m option.
		-s	- write data to a single file, putting memory
			  space information into the address field of the
			  S0 header record. Replaces the -1 option.
			  Bytes may be reversed with the -r option.
			  The -m and -s options are mutually exclusive.
		-w	- use word addressing when transferring load addresses
			  to S-record addresses.  This means that load file
			  DATA record start addresses are moved unchanged and
			  subsequent S1/S3 record addresses are computed
			  based on the data word count.

	DIAGNOSTICS
		The program does some checking for invalid input record
		formats, memory spaces, and hex values.  It obviously
		cannot check for bad data values if the load file has
		been tampered with.  Both START and END records must be
		found in the input file.
