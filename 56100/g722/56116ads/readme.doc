Subject:  This readme file explains the result of the self test
program that resides on the ADM56116.

Revision:  00

This readme file will explain the fte000.asm, dated 05-30-90
source that is on this disk.  This asm file was assembled via the
56116 assembler and then through srec.  The resulting eproms now
reside on the adm56116.  

The fte000 program is a selftest program that resides at e000. 
Therefore, when powering up in mode 2, this program is executed. 
There are 9 addresses that are of importance when executing this
program.  These addresses simply loop on themselves and signify
either a pass or failure.  Eight of these addresses relate to BAD
addresses and 1 GOOD addresses.  The following list details these
locations.

1.  p:e032     Bad address indicating test 11 failed.
2.  p:e064     Bad address indicating test 12 failed.
3.  p:e09e     Bad address indicating test 13 failed.
4.  p:e0d2     Bad address indicating test 21 failed.
5.  p:e104     Bad address indicating test 22 failed.
6.  p:e13e     Bad address indicating test 23 failed.
7.  p:e184     Bad address indicating test 31 or 32 failed.
8.  p:e1d9     Bad address indicating test 33 or 34 failed.

9.  p:e1d7     GOOD ADDRESS - ALL TESTS PASS !!!!

Test 11 is an address test for program memory.  It places a 0 in
location 400, 1 in location 401, 2 in location 402, etc.  The
reason for starting at address 400 is because internal programs
are run in this area in the functional test at the factory.  This
may change in the future to include more locations.

Test 12 is a walking one test through the data bits as the
address bus is incremented simultaneously i.e. (1 in location
400, 2 in location 401, 4 in location 402, etc.).

Test 13 is a walking zero test through the data bits as the
address bus is incremented simultaneously i.e. (fffe in location
400, fffd in location 401, fffb in location 402, etc.).

Tests 21 - 23 are identical to the above tests except that X data
memory is exercised and the starting location is at 0000 instead
of 0400.

NOTE:  NOTICE THAT SINCE THE ADM5616 IS FACTORY CONFIGURED IN
       MODE 2, 2K OF EXTERNAL RAM IS OVERLAPPED WITH 2K OF
       INTERNAL RAM.  THIS MEANS THAT THE BOTTOM 2K OF
       EXTERNAL PROGRAM AND X DATA MEMORY ARE NOT UTILIZED.  

Test 31 is a walking one test of the lower 12 bits of portb wired
to portc.  The schematic for this loopback connector is shown
below.

Test 32 is a walking one test of the upper 3 bits of portb wired
to portb.  The schematic for this loopback connector is shown
below.

Test 33 is a walking zero test of the lower 12 bits of portb
wired to portc.  The schematic for this loopback connector is
shown below.

Test 34 is a walking zero test of the upper 3 bits of portb wired
to portb.  The schematic for this loopback connector is shown
below.

NOTE:  TESTS 31 - 34 REQUIRE THE INSTALLATION OF THE LOOPBACK
       CONNECTOR, WHOSE SCHEMATIC IS SHOWN BELOW, TO ENSURE
       PROPER OPERATION OF TESTS 31 - 34.  THESE TESTS WILL
       UNDOUBTEDLY FAIL WITHOUT THIS CONNECTOR INSTALLED INTO
       EITHER LOCATION J1 OR J2.  THE FOLLOWING SCHEMATIC IS
       PROVIDED TO BUILD SUCH A CONNECTOR.

PB0 ---------- PC0 ------+
PB1 ---------- PC1 ----- | ----+
PB2 ---------- PC2 ----- | --- | ----+
PB3 ---------- PC3       |     |     |
PB4 ---------- PC4       |     |     |
PB5 ---------- PC5       |     |     |
PB6 ---------- PC6       |     |     |
PB7 ---------- PC7       |     |     |
PB8 ---------- PC8       |     |     |
PB9 ---------- PC9       |     |     |
PB10 --------- PC10      |     |     |
PB11 --------- PC11      |     |     |
PB12 --------------------+     |     |
PB13 --------------------------+     |
PB14 --------------------------------+

     LOOPBACK CONNECTOR FOR PORTB / PORTC.

The procedure for running the self test is as follows.

1.  GO E000
2.  FORCE BREAK
3.  DISPLAY ON P:40..41 P:50..5F
4.  DISPLAY

Look at the PC address to find out what address the selftest is
looping on.  Compare that value with the table above to find out
what test(s) are failing.  The address location of P:40 should
have a 1 (this indicates that indeed a failure did occur).  The
address location of P:41 will give the actual test number that
failed.  The address locations of P:50..5F is an error pad that
indicates the ADDRESS of the failure, what the test EXPECTED, and
what was the ACTUAL value read.  With this information a
debugging scenario is formulated.
