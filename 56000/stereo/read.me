The code for the AM stereo decoder decodes Motorola C-QUAM AM stereo
system from a baseband signal.  The I and Q outputs of the QAM
demodulator should be sampled at a 16Khz rate to use this code 
correctly.  If  I and Q are samples at the 16 Khz rate, the I and
Q signals will be used to find the cos(*) term which then can be
used to divide the I and Q signals to get L+R+C and L-R to resolve
the left and right channel information.

If more information than what is given here and in the code is 
desired, the author may be contacted at the Motorola DSP
